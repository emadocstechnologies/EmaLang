EMA is a high-performance programming language and compiler architecture designed to unify the entire web stack into a single, cohesive syntax. It allows developers to build systems ranging from native database engines to reactive web dashboards without switching languages or managing fragmented dependencies.

## 🏗️ THE UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE
EMA replaces the traditional overhead of decoupled tech stacks with a native, unified execution model.

- **Frontend (`@client`)**: Compiles to optimized WebAssembly or lifted JavaScript. Features Scoped CSS-in-EMA for zero-conflict styling.
- **Backend (`@server`)**: Direct Rust-speed machine code. Integrated with EMA-DB (SQLite/PostgreSQL) for seamless data persistence.
- **V1.0 Robustness**: Hardened lexer and parser logic ensuring professional-grade reliability for enterprise applications.

---

## 🚀 GETTING STARTED
With the EMA V1.0 CLI, you can initialize and deploy "World-Standard" applications in seconds.

```powershell
# Create a professional project structure
ema create my-awesome-app

# Compile and Deploy with zero configuration
ema --deploy Web/app.ema

# Access the interactive development shell
ema repl
```

---

## 🎨 CODE EXAMPLE: FULL-STACK UNIFICATION
A single `.ema` file manages your state, database, and UI logic simultaneously.

```ema
# Define a database model (Auto-Migration)
model Product { id: int, name: str, price: float }

@server {
    print "Ema Server Initialized: Port 3000";
    std::http::serve(3000);
}

@client {
    state cart_total = 0.0;

    <div style: "background: #0f172a; padding: 40px; border-radius: 20px; color: white;">
        <h1 style: "font-size: 2.5rem;"> "EMA V1.0 Ecosystem" </h1>
        <p> "Current Balance: $" {{ cart_total }} </p>
        
        @js {
            // Native JavaScript blocks directly in your UI logic
            async function triggerCelebration() {
                console.log("Ema Engine: Processing world-class event...");
            }
            triggerCelebration();
        }
    </div>
}
```

## 🛠️ CORE CAPABILITIES
- **`ema create`**: Professional project scaffolding with built-in best practices.
- **Scoped Styling**: Automatic CSS isolation for every component.
- **Hot-Port Discovery**: Automatically handles port conflicts during development.
- **Zero-Dependency Bundle**: Compiles down to a minimal, high-efficiency production artifact.
